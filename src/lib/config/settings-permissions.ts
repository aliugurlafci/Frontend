/**
 * Settings permission catalog — the Settings screen broken down into individually
 * grantable areas and operations.
 *
 * Screen access ("may this position open /settings at all?") is coarse: one
 * `settings` key in the screen catalog. This catalog is the fine-grained layer on
 * top of it — every section of the Settings screen, and every operation inside a
 * section, is its own grant so a position can e.g. read the user list without
 * being able to reset passwords.
 *
 * Grants are plain `<area>:<action>` strings — the same shape (and the same
 * wildcard rules) the entity matrix uses, so they live in a position's
 * `permissions` array alongside `deal:update` and friends and need no engine
 * change. Areas are namespaced under `settings.` to keep them off the entity map.
 *
 * Mirrored verbatim in Backend/src/lib/config/settings-permissions.ts.
